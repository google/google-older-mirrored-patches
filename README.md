These days, our patches and code generally are put into GitHub or Gerrit projects. However, there are still a very small number of patches and tarballs that were available through http://code.google.com/opensource/patches.html.

All of those have now been moved to this project.

Please Note: Google does not offer support around the use, build process, form, architecture or function of these patches and mirrored packages. Questions can be directed to code@google.com. These patches and mirrored packages are provided for your information and to comply with various open source licenses.
